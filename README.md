# ``BbAppConfiguration``

Application configuration and user preferences management.

## Overview

The BbAppConfiguration library provides an observable configuration manager that persists user preferences and application state. It manages authenticated user information, color scheme preferences, and guest author data. The configuration is automatically persisted to UserDefaults and provides both read and write access to all configuration properties through a centralized, observable interface.
